class Solution:
    # two indexes: ransom_i, magazine_i
    # sort both ransomNote and magazine (ascending order)
    # while indexes have not reached the end:
    # - if ransom symbol is equal to the magazine_symbol: increase both indexes
    # - if it is not equal, increase only magazine index
    # return wheter the ranson index is equal to the length of the ransom
