class Solution:
    # check edge cases:
    # - if length of the needle is less than the length of the haystack: -1
    # - if strings are equal: 0
    # - if length of the needle is equal to the length of the haystack, but
    #   strings are not equal: -1
    # iterate over haystack and needle cheking if a substring starting with the current symbol
    # is equal to the needle

        if length_needle > length_haystack:
            return -1
